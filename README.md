This is a decentralized web app build using the ethereum blockchain. It is used for creating charity campaigns. It requires the campaign creator to provide with the 
public address of the recepient's ethereum wallet for complete transparency. Users can then view the campaigns and decide whom to donate according to their choice. They can
also vote whether to go ahead with the charity campaign or not.
